      <description>TRS-80 Model III   The first code I wrote was written in BASIC on a Radio Shack Tandy TRS-80 Model III. I still have a fond admiration of the gray and black plastic with black and white screen all-in-one computer.
How I miss those simple days. I was blisfully unaware of &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; program structure or the &amp;lsquo;right way&amp;rsquo; of writing code. It was all about having fun.
Backstory Note: I have omitted a lot of detail here to keep this story managable.</description>
